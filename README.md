## Description
- Predict_FWI is a project which uses a Ridge Linear Machine learning model to predict Fire Weather Index. Predicting Fire Weather Index turns out to be important because with the help of this we can predict potential chances of wildfires in a forest. 
- Imagine being able to predict wildfires with the help of this model integrated with IOT devices and various live weather APIs with real time prediction and alerting forest department of priorly. 
This will definitely save various flora and fauna of that areas.
- Right now this project is capable enough to predict FWI with reference to Algerian forest fire dataset with an accuracy of 98 percent.
- Further scope of this project is to integrate it with real time weather apis along with an alert system.

## Dataset Used
- Algerian Forest Fires Dataset
- The dataset includes 244 instances that regroup a data of two regions of Algeria, namely the Bejaia region located in the northeast of Algeria and the Sidi Bel-abbes region located in the northwest of Algeria.

- 122 instances for each region.

- The period from June 2012 to September 2012.
- The dataset includes 11 attributes and 1 output attribute (class)
- The 244 instances have been classified into fire (138 classes) and not fire (106 classes) classes.
