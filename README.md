## Description
- Predict_FWI is a project which uses a Ridge Linear Machine learning model to predict Fire Weather Index. Predicting Fire Weather Index turns out to be important because with the help of this we can predict potential chances of wildfires in a forest. 
- Imagine being able to predict wildfires with the help of this model integrated with IOT devices and various live weather APIs with real time prediction and alerting forest department of priorly. 
This will definitely save various flora and fauna of that areas.
- Right now this project is capable enough to predict FWI with reference to Algerian forest fire dataset with an accuracy of 98 percent.
- Further scope of this project is to integrate it with real time weather apis and with alert system.
